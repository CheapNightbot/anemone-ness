## Installation

To get started with Anemone, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/CheapNightbot/anemone-ness.git
```

OR if you already have initialized the directory as a git repository:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/CheapNightbot/anemone-ness.git themes/anemone-ness
```

2. Enable Anemone in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "anemone-ness"
```

## Options

Anemone provides various options to customize your website:

#### Default Taxonomies

To use tags, add the following code to a page's metadata:

```toml
[taxonomies]
tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]
```

#### Pages List in Homepage

Enable listing of pages in the homepage by adding the following code to `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
list_pages = true
```

#### Multilanguage

The theme has a built-in feature that allows you to use multiple languages. For detailed instructions on how to use this feature, you can refer to the [Zola Multilingual documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/). This documentation provides additional information on how to make the most out of this multilingual capability.

```toml
[languages.fr]
weight = 2
title = "anemone"
languageName = "Fran√ßais"
languageCode = "fr"
generate_feed = true

taxonomies = [
    {name = "tags", feed = true},
]
```
#### Multilanguage-Ready Navigation Bar

Customize the header navigation links with the following code in the `extra` section of `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]

header_nav = [
  { url = "/", name_en = "/home/", name_fr = "/accueil/" },
  { url = "/about", name_en = "/about/", name_fr = "/concernant/" },
  { url = "/journal", name_en = "/journal/", name_fr = "/journal/" },
  { url = "/blog", name_en = "/blog/", name_fr = "/blog/" }
]
```

#### Add Table of Contents (TOC) to Pages

In a page's frontmatter, set `extra.toc` to `true`:

```toml
[extra]
toc = true
```

#### Display Author Name in Blog Posts

Customize the display of the author's name in your blog posts by toggling the `display_author` variable to either `true` or `false`:

```toml
[extra]
display_author = true
```

### [Shortcodes](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/)

#### Highlight

```html
{{ mark(content="I'm Highlighted") }}
```

#### Format Date & Time

- `{{ date_format(date="2024-04-01") }}` will look like: **April 01, 2024**
- `{{ date_format_journal(date="2024-04-01T03:56:00")}}` will look like: **Monday at 03:56 AM**

#### Webrings

Add a webring with a shortcode:

```html
{{ webring(prev="#", webring="#", webringName="Random Webring", next="#") }}
```

### Extra Data

- Set the `author` in both the main config and in pages metadata.
- Use the `image` variable in pages to add an image to HTML `<meta>` tags.
- Similarly, set `favicon` in the main config, and it will be used as the site icon.
- Set `footer_content_license` and `footer_content_license_link` if you wish to display content license information in the footer.

#### Disable Twitter Card

Twitter metatags are generated by default. To disable them, set `extra.twitter_card` to `false` in `config.toml`:

```toml
[extra]
twitter_card = true
```

The Anemone theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).
